# Use a quotes API, e.g. https://zenquotes.io/api/random
# to fetch a random quote. Then use string manipulation to convert it to
# Doge speech (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme))
# Create a tiny webpage that displays a doge image together
# with the altered quote. You can get an image URL from another API:
# https://dog.ceo/api/breed/shiba/images/random
# Write the code logic to make the API calls and assign the output to
# `doged_quote` and `doge_image_url` respectively.
# Then write the `html` string to a `.html` file and look at it in your browser.
